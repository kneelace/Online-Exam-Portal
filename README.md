# AceIT -- Online Exam Portal

## Project Description

This project is helpful for students, companies or any organization to conduct any examinations from this site. In this age of increased competition, various companies, organization’s face a common problem of conducting online exam by personally visiting to different colleges (in case of companies) for placement drives. Manually going through thousands of colleges and conducting interviews requires a lot of time, efforts and money, this is the reason that most of the companies prefer visiting only top most colleges. The students of low-grade colleges despite of having the calibre to compete are not getting enough exposure to job profiles of their choices and end up getting a low satisfying job. To reduce this gap between these companies or any organization and such potential candidates this platform will help the deserving candidates to showcase their conceptual skills through an online exam, based on which, the companies can filter out candidates according to their needs. 

>Basically, we are providing an online exam system where we host exams to create report of candidates which can be viewed by the 
>companies.This will not only help the companies or any organization to analyze and select the cream candidates which meet company’s 
>requirements but also, help the students to get exposure to enough companies.
